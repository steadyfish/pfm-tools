# financial-affordability-toolkit
Open source toolkit empowering individuals to make informed financial decisions through privacy-preserving analysis of their bank transactions data

## Problem
To access credit, underserved individuals need to share their sensitive financial data to multiple corporations (lenders, credit bureaus, data aggregators). This creates privacy and cybersecurity risk while perpetuating information asymmetry. Corporations leverage network effects but individuals remain isolated.

## Solution
Local-first financial analysis tools that:
- Process transaction data locally on user's device
- Provide affordability assessments for BNPL, loans, credit decisions
- Enable federated learning for community driven insights without data exposure
- Integrate with community financial institutions

## Status
In development
